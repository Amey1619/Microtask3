This is just a simple design of submiting Quote according to this page :https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Quotations#Formatting

I have tried to make it to avoid emptyspaces , whitespaces and numeric values but still some improvements can be 
made like a generateQuote function that can be incorporated in the code which will gives us the preview of entered text enclosed in double quotes like 
for eg:-
Time management is life management to "Time management is life management"
We simply have to entered the text and function wrap the text in double quotes itself.
