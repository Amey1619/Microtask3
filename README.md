This is just a simple design of submiting Quote according to this page :https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Quotations#Formatting

I have tried to make it to avoid emptyspaces , whitespaces and numeric values still some can improvements can be 
made like a generateQuote function can incorporated in it which will gives the preview of entered text enclosed in double quotes like 
for eg:-
"Time management is life management"
We simply have to entered the text and function wrap the text in double quotes itself.
